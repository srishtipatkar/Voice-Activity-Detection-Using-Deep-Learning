# Voice-Activity-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project shows how to detect regions of speech in a low signal-to-noise environment using deep learning. The project uses the Speech Commands Dataset to train a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network to detect voice activity.
- Dataset used for training and validation was Google Speech Commands Dataset.
